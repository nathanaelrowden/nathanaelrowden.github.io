        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>I am a very organized person but sometimes I can get lost in the little things. I would like to create a site
            that helps to organize all sorts of information. Wether you are looking for a way to create an easy schedule
            or for a place to keep track of a list of your movies or books, this website is for you. </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>This will be targeted towards coolege students, but high school students and buisness profesionals could make
            great use of this tool as well. Individuals could use this for personal plans and to dos. Buisnesses could
            use this to help organize and plan for meetings and tasks. This could also be used by anyone looking to
            organize content in to lists such as a list of pros and cons.</p>
