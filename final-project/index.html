                Ways to have fun
            </h3>

            <p class="home-paragraph-1">
                Most of us are pretty good at having fun. We have plenty of ideas that we are already used to taking
                advantage of. Most of us know about Netflix, Hulu and other streaming sites. Other people like to play
                video games. Some people even play board games still. I am here to give you just a few more ideas on how
                to spend your time having fun during the quarantine. If you want a few new ideas go ahead and click on
                the “Fun” tab!

                Ways to stay productive
            </h3>
            <p class="home-paragraph-2">
                The less appealing way to spend our time during this quarantine is by being productive. To be fair we
                should probably all be more productive all the time anyway, but we all know we have no desire to
                actually do something that isn’t immediately fun. If you are actually able to pull yourself away from
                the TV and think about doing some chores here are a few ideas of where to start. Click on the
                “Productive” tab to get some ideas. This is the goal! [Look down]

                If there is something that you are doing to keep yourself busy that is not on either of my lists please
                feel comfortable submitting a suggestion. Let’s all do what we can to help each other out during this
                time of uncertainty. If you have a suggestion please click on the “Suggestion Box” tab.
