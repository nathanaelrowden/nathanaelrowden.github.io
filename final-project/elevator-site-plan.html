        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>I am often find my self with time to dedicate towards somthing other than work, school or church. Especially
            right now since we are in the middile of a quarantine. This website is dedicated to helping provide ideas to
            people during this quarantine on they shouodl spend their time. </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>This will be targeted towards college students here in Rexurg, Idaho. I know this quarantine is world wide
            and everyone is more than welcome to use this site, but I will be building it specfcall for college age
            peeople here in Rexburg. I want to make the activities realtable as well as age appropriate, Many people
            ehre have young kids and many of these activities are perfect from them. Also I will be able to draw in some
            church ideas a well know that my audience mostly consits of people who attend church regularly. </p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Helvetica</h4>
        <p>This is a very easy font to read but it is also a tad fancy which I like. I thought about using another font
            that was going to make it look more like digitized handwriting but it didnt fit the simple aspect of my
            website.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Arial</h4>
        <p>This is a great Sans Serif font. I think it is easy to read and goes well with the simple design I am hoping
            to achieve. My previous idea was to use a font similar to the font of Visual studio code but I changed my
            website idea and didnt think it fit after that.</p>
