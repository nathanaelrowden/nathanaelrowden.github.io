                Time to yourself
            </h3>
            <p class="fun-paragraph-1">
                Before technology humans used to entertain themselves with something called a book. This is a great time
                to crack one of those bad boys open. Get lost in a fantasy world or learn about something new from a
                nonfiction history book. Other than reading you could also develop a new talent. Pick up a musical
                instrument, do some wood working or even pick up that dumbbell again. Working out can be fun, don’t
                forget it also has health benefits as well. Finally, if you are adventurous maybe give cooking a try.
                Being creative and inventive in the kitchen can be fun and even lead to some tasty meals… sometimes.

                Time with others
            </h3>
            <p class="fun-paragraph-2">
                One great thing about technology is that it can connect us to those that we love during this trying
                time. Take time call your loved ones and spend some time with each other virtually. Whether you are with
                roommates, parents or your spouse there are many things you can do to keep yourself busy and have fun.
                Take time to talk and learn more about each other. Do each other’s favorite things and don’t be afraid
                to take pictures. Draw and paint with one another, read to each other or even do a puzzle. If you have
                kids or if there is a big group of you break out those nerf guns or maybe some sports equipment. Even
                though you can’t spend time with other people being outside in your own yard is allowed.

                My Choices
            </h3>
            <p class="fun-paragraph-3">
                I myself, and I’m sure I’m not alone in this, love to watch movies, TV and play video game. I am a
                nerd
                through and through and I can gladly say I have converted my wife on many of these passions of mine,
                however I do love some of these other options as well. My wife and I just completed a very large
                Star
                Wars puzzle. We have water colored with one another and we ever started working out again. Although
                I
                wouldn’t say these are my favorite things to do they were very fun! Maybe give some of them a try
                and
                let me know what you think in the suggestion box.
