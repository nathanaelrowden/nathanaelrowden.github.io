                Extended spring cleaning
            </h3>
            <p class="productive-paragraph-1">
                Many would agree that spring break has come, gone and never existed. One thing that is great to do when
                spring starts is spring cleaning. Some of you may do your best to wash a dish or take out the trash now
                and then but now is a great time to finally deep clean your home. Other than the regular cleaning we
                should be doing almost every day here are a few ideas of things that definitely need to some attention.
                Don’t forget about the toilet bowl, tank and behind the tank as well. Under the fridge, under the oven
                and even under the dishwasher. Don’t forget to empty the lint trap of your dryer and then give the back
                a good vacuum. Maybe throw your sheets in the wash and buy a second pair, what could it hurt? When we
                are all stuck inside we are constantly missing some vital Vitamin D, give all your windows a good wash
                and enjoy the increased light your life will have. Now that your house is clean what else can you do?

                Do what needs to get done
            </h3>
            <p class="productive-paragraph-2">
                A few items that may need addressing in most peoples are things that many may not think of… ever. If you
                have a car don’t forget to give it some love as well. Don’t just clean the inside, take care of the
                engine, tires and other aspects as well. Google is your friend it comes to car maintenance if you don’t
                know what to do, You Tube university can help. It is Tax season and even though President Trump gave us
                an extension does mean we should wait longer than we have too. Don’t forget about homework or church
                obligations just because we are quarantined doesn’t mean our responsibilities stop.

                My Choice
            </h3>
            <p class="productive-paragraph-3">
                One of the biggest ones on this list that I definitely need to attend to is the deep clean. This project
                is my final school assignment I need to complete and then after that I plan on taking some time to
                seriously change the state of my home. Luckily my wife is amazing and is already on top of a lot of
                this, but I’m not going to let her have all the fun.
