        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Merienda</h4>
        <p>I think that all headings should stand out. I have always used fonts like Merienda as my fonts
            in Microsoft Word and I think it really stands out.
        </p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Lato</h4>
        <p>I have never used Lato before, but I saw it as an option on this document so I googled it. I really like it
            and think it is easy on the eyes and simple to read and follow.
        </p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>

            Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
            Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.</p>
